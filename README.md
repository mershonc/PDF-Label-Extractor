# Carson's PDF Label Extractor
A simple tool to extract and save custom labels from PDF files. Select a region, preview it, and save as a high-quality 4x6 PDF label. Built with Python and tkinter.

Carson's PDF Label Extractor is a user-friendly application designed to extract and save labels from PDF documents. The program enables users to visually select regions of interest (ROIs) from PDF pages and save these selections as high-resolution 4x6 PDF labels. This project is built with Python and leverages key libraries such as tkinter for the graphical user interface, pdf2image for PDF conversion, and cv2 for image processing.

# Key Features: 
1. PDF Selection and Conversion: Users can load PDF files and extract their first page as a high-resolution image.
2. Region of Interest Selection: An interactive interface allows users to select areas from the image with adjustable scaling to match the screen size.
3. Preview Functionality: The selected region is displayed within the application for verification.
4. Label Saving: The selected area can be resized to fit a standard 4x6 label size and saved as a PDF.
5. Clear and Reset Options: Users can easily clear the selection and choose a different PDF file.
6. Streamlined UI: The application features a clean, accessible design with hover effects and button state management.

This tool is ideal for quickly generating labels from existing PDF documents, whether for organizational purposes, shipping, or archiving needs. I personally created this project to get just the shipping labels from amazon return pdfs to print directly with my thermal printer!
